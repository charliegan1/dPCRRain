A tool to help analyze Bio-rad QX600 rain between clusters. Calculates percent rain of each target in your assay with summary statistics. Upload your own data .csv files from QX600. "Import/Export" --> Export visible data to CSV. Upload one where the gating is close to the positive cluster for all targets, then upload another one where the gating is close to the negative cluster for all targets.
